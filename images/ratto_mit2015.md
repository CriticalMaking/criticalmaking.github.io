^Over the last few years, the long-standing ‘firewall’ between critical thinking and physical making has been toppling, in no small part due to scholars and practitioners in design, the digital humanities, and other areas who have developed specific modes of material/conceptual engagement. While most critical work within the academy remains focused on linguistic processes and outputs, “critical making” (broadly construed) is more and more finding a place within pedagogical and research-oriented contexts. ^However, in order to develop critical making, there remains a need to overcome simplistic understandings both in terms of a perceived aporia between language and the physical world and an associated assumed immediacy regarding relations between language and critique. On one hand, we need to be clear that material engagements can both support traditional process of critique and critical thinking and, at the same time, constitute forms of critique in and of themselves. But on the other hand we should not fall into realist material determinisms, naive materialisms or vitalistic perspectives where it is assumed that materials speak for and by themselves in ways that are more ‘true’ than our linguistic representations. ^The pivot point upon which critical making turns is therefore nothing more or less than the old questions regarding relations between the natural world and the social world that (and perhaps I am projecting here) attracted many of us to Science and Technology Studies. The criticality of making stands upon a return to the ‘material-semiotic’, but with potentially novel resources for addressing the relations named not by either term, but by the hyphen that connects them. Unlike Latour, I do not think the hyphen is the ‘nail in the coffin’ (1999) of apparatus like ‘actor-network theory’ or ‘material-semiotic actors’ but instead constitutes the actual site of these theories’ criticality. ^While there are many ways to establish the ‘critical-ness’ of making, my particular interest is to what degree material engagements gives us new modes for exploring the entanglements of the material and the semiotic and the ways these entanglements support or trouble what Marcuse called ‘the forces of liberation”. (1969)

^We are used to scholarship on technology that does not seem to require much knowledge of the material characteristics of technical systems, replacing such knowledge with what I have in the past called ‘textual doppelgangers’ (Ratto, 2012; 2014). ‘Critical makers’ (as a general category) have begun to incorporate more technical background and understandings within their work. But for the most part, such work requires that they learn how to engage with technical systems using the pedagogies and practices drawn from technical fields. But what do we take on, when we learn using such systems? 

Certainly, the genre of the tutorial or the technical instruction carries with it particular ways to parse the world into technical and non-technical domains - part of what tutorials do is that tell us what is important for us to pay attention to. And while I don't believe that it is impossible to overcome 


Given the critical importance of such divisions, it is important to look at such trainings in order to better understand how current engagements with the technical may be hindering critical approaches. ^In my teaching and research I frequently make use of the arduino microcontroller system as do many others interested in physical computation systems and pedaogogy (cites here recommended by reviewers.) And, as part of the process, I often use tutorial materials found online, through making sites such as Adafruit, Sparkfun, or Instructables.
^As has been made clear by others (CF Agre, 1997) moments of technical training are rife with what has been called ‘socialization.’ (cites) We might in fact go so far as to describe technical training as a primary site when standard ideas of technology and concommittment values of instrumentality and rationality are reified.

^This being the case, can we as critical makers rely on  

^So much of STS work has asked us to move, as Suchman puts it: 

“…from categorical debates to empirical investigations of the concrete practices through which categories of human and nonhuman are mobilized.”
